Codes here are part of the introduction to python course on [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). They can be run by simply copy pasting the source in the online editor at [www.codekulptor.org](http://www.codeskulptor.org).

My personal save of Blackjack is at [http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user15_2uy7X8xptv_2.py](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user15_2uy7X8xptv_2.py). But the developers may clear the local saves any time, and hence I have made a backup of the same.
